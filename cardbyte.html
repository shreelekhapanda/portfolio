            <h4><br>OVERVIEW</h4>
            <p>This project was undertaken by me as part of my summer internship with <b>Liberin Technologies Pvt. Ltd.</b> It was a 4-months long enthralling experience of working amongst amazing team of product designers, illustrator, developers and business personnel. As per the client requirement, our task was to design and develop an app which made sharing of digital business cards simpler and easier. Pertaining to the present pandemic situation, this was an amazing idea to go digital and completely avoid physical contact which was a mandatory occurence in sharing physical business cards.</p>

        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <p>The following user stories were drafted at the end of an extensive brainstorming procedure with the design team, along with inputs from the client. This was also validated by the results obtained at the end of user and market research. These helped us to define the major goals and expectations of the app, and further layout the task flow.</p>

        <h2>Low-fidelity Prototyping</h2><br>
        <p>We started by sketching out as many concepts, as we could. For this, we chose the login screen and the home screen for exploration and decided to work around the selected UI concept for all the other screens. As per the client requirement, the prime focus was to design intuitive, minimal and simple interfaces which were aesthetically 'different' from majority of the apps.</p>

                <li><u>Decide upon the color palette:</u><br>The colors were selected keeping in mind that the app would be used by varying group of users, and also permits customization.</li>
                <li><u>Design the app logo:</u><br>Keeping in mind the client requirements, we needed to design the brand identity which was minimal, has a 3D look and feel and incudes the element card and letters C and B.</li>

        <h2>High-fidelity Prototyping</h2>
        <p>As the final stage of the project, we created high-fidelity prototypes using Adobe XD. At this point, we also focussed on interaction design of the app. The interface were in line with the visual design finalised previously. The screens were designed to give a feel of real-world materials. As the app was primarily a 'Digital Cards app', the interface and all the UI elements were inspired from physical cards. The interactions were kept clean, realistic and minimal. <br><br>Have a look at some of the modules of interaction in the app!</p>

        <h2>Present Status and Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Currently, the app screens designed in Adobe XD are converted into Zeplin and Flutter files and forwarded to the development team who are developing it using Flutter. The present focus is on the starter plan, excluding the premium version which requires subscription. Based on the real usage data of the app, the premium features are intended to be rolled out soon. Also, the design team is still working on the visual design of 'card customization' UI to make it more interactive and simpler to use.<br><br>As a metric of success of our venture, we had laid our objective that users would prefer Cardbyte over (i) Physical Business Cards and (ii) Contacts app, Whatsapp, etc. for sharing/saving professional contacts. And we found out that over 90% users would prefer digital, customizable cards over Physical Business Cards. For the second objective, even though users were enthusiastic about a separate app for professional contacts, we have to see for ourselves, the real app usage.<br><br>This was my first experience of working in a team of designers, developers among others to design a product that would be rolled out in the real world. It was quite a learning phase for me. I would definitely admit that my knowledge of design tools, analytical methods and user research processes was strenghtened at the end of the internship and I am thankful to Liberin Technologies for the opportunity.<br><br>Hope you liked my work! Thank you!</p>
