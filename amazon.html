			<h4><br>OVERVIEW</h4>
			<p>The main reason for me to take up this project was to get a practical insight into the UX design process by redesigning a familiar app, which has a poor interface and UX, especially for the "mom-users". Amazon app being widely used worldwide, seemed to be the perfect choice serving this purpose. The goal of this project was to identify common usability and accessibilty issues in the app and therefore provide an enjoyable, clutter-free shopping experience even for a first- time user. The expected outcome was a cleaner, minimal, user-friendly interface for the e-commerce app, Amazon.</p>
			<h2>The Process</h2>
			<p>At the beginning, it was mandatory for me to plan out the different steps to undertake, keeping in mind the <em>Design thinking</em> principles. The entire process was broadly split into two different stages.</p>
				<ol>
					<li><em>Current Design Analysis-</em> Inspecting the current app for usabilty issues and elaborate User research</li>
					<li><em>Unsolicited Redesign-</em>Suggestions for a better User Experience through a more intuitive User Interface</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The process below briefs the iterative designing process followed by me. Scroll down to read about the entire case study.</p><br>

			</figure>
		
		<h2>Evaluating the Interface</h2>
		<p>In this stage, I evaluated the Amazon app screens using the three methods: <strong>Informal Action Analysis, Cognitive Walkthrough</strong> and <strong>Heuristic Analysis</strong>. Following were my findings:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Opening the app for the first time leads you to the signing in screen, however there's an option to skip it all together. Also, an option to create an account.</li>
					<li>Amidst so much clutter, it is difficult to learn about the categories of products available.</li>
					<li>The search option is unreliable and doesn't relate to product categories for easy searching.</li>
					<li>Filter options are clumsy, unorganised and not user-friendly. Many important and product-relevant filter options to aid in a better shopping experience could have been added.</li>
					<li>While checking out a product, one can't find the "Buy Now" or "Add to cart" options right on the screen. One needs to scroll down and find the buttons.</li>
					<li>Payment and address options are also poorly organised.</li>
					<li>Instead of "Swipe to place order", a button to "confirm order" is better.</li>
					<li>Users should have freedom to cancel ordering go back in case they proceeded to place an order by mistake.</li>
				</ol>

		<h2>User Research</h2>
		<p>This is the most crucial step in the UX process. At the end of this, I expected to learn about the different groups of users, the goals they want to achieve through the app and also, to empathize with their pain points. It is impossible to learn about users without interacting with them, talking or meeting them. So, I carried out this process in the following phases.</p>
			
			<h3>Online Surveys-</h3>
				<p>In order to gather preliminary quantitative and qualitative data, it was important to gather as much data as possible. This couldn't be possible by meeting people individually. Therefore, I carried out an online survey using <em>Google Forms</em> and forwarded it via mail and WhatsApp to a varied group of (50) users belonging to different walks of life. This helped me gather insights into:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The demographics of users(age, gender, occupation</li>
						<li>Frequency of shopping online: App users account for approximately 42% of Amazon’s smartphone visits, while visits to Amazon.com make up the other 58%</li>
						<li>Other shopping apps used and their favourite(if any)</li>
						<li>Category of products usually purchased</li>
						<li>Problems faced by them using Amazon app</li>
						<li>Whether they rely on reviews on the app or research about the product elsewhere</li>
						<li>Whether users wanted an update in the app interface</li>
					</ul>
				
			<h3>Interviews-</h3>
				<p>Apart from focussed preliminary data obtained via surveys, it was also important to interview few users, to collect elaborate data regarding the app. The five selected users were chosen such that they were well acquainted with the app and/or frequent users. They however belonged to different walks of life and different age groups. <br>
				The users were asked specific questions and also asked to walk me through the app and explain whatever issues they faced with the app.</p>
				
			<h3>Observation-</h3>
				<p>This was also important in order to learn about the users, as it helps to unfathom data which the users may not be able to vocalize or express. In this process, users were observed while they actually used the app and notes were made. For each of these following methods, a frequent user and a first-time user was asked to use the app.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Aimless Browsing-</strong> Users were observed as they aimlessly browsed the app and carried out any task they like, for example, wishlisting an item, searching for a specific product or buying a product. As they did so, I made notes about what they were saying or doing all the way and also added comments about their expressions and frustrations.</li>
						<li><strong>Task-specific Browsing-</strong> Users were given a specific task to carry out and the time taken to carry out the task(if they could) was noted down. Next they were also interviewed to learn about their pain points and feedback about the app.</li>
					</ul>

		<h2>Analysing Data from User Research</h2>
		<p>In order to analyse the data obtained from my findings by evaluating the app interfaces and the data obtained by surveying, interviewing and observing users, I used the methods of card sorting and creating User Personas. Also, in this step I had to prioritise issues according to user feedback, in order to narrow down the scope of work, because taking care of all grievances of users seemed impossible. <br><br>

		For my main objective, the user persona created is what we define as a <strong>'Mom-user'</strong>. The amazon app, being so popular worldwide, should have better usability for a first-time user , or someone with less technical-knowledge. This would make sure that the overall usability is improved for frequent shoppers, as well.</p>

		<h2>Low Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
		<p>I began with sketching some of the screens, which needed to be changed. Then I proceeded to wireframing them, before jumping to high-fidelity prototyping. There were four major points I kept in mind from this stage onwards:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To make the UI minimal</li>
			<li>To ensure that the look and feel is consistent throughout the app</li>
			<li>To simplify the checkout process</li>
			<li>To simplify the product search process- Avoid clutter</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Wireframing</h3>
		<p>At the end of this stage, the layout was almost finalised after obtaining feedback from users of the app. The UI was monochrome, images were avoided and real icons(monochrome) were used. Check some of the wireframes below.</p>
